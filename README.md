LectureTime is a system designed for modern universities which want to pass knowledge in the most efficent way.
In a coherent, convenient way, it provides the functionality most commonly used in education:
- information about courses

LectureTime uses the LDAP service provided by the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań. LectureTime itself does not store user credentials. We recommend to implement custom authentication / no authentication in order to use app without access to University LDAP service.
