LectureTime is a tool designed for modern universities which want to pass knowledge in the most efficent way.
In a coherent, convenient way, it provides the functionality most commonly used in education:

LectureTime uses the LDAP service provided by the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna≈Ñ. LectureTime itself does not store user credentials. We recommend to implement custom authentication / no authentication in order to use app without access to University LDAP service.
